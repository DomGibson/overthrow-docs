# What is Arma 3 Overthrow?
Arma 3 Overthrow is a mod for Arma 3 that adds a new game mode to the game. It is a cooperative game mode where players work together to complete objectives and survive against the AI.

The premise of the gamemode is that you are a resistance group fighting against a corrupt government. You are tasked with completing objectives to help the resistance and to weaken the government. The government is also tasked with completing objectives to strengthen their control over the island.

## Required DLC
- APEX - Some buildings and items from APEX are used by Overthrow, yes even on Altis, we apologize but you should grab it anyway, Overthrow is arguably best played on the Tanoa map.

## Recommended DLC
These DLC are NOT required, however will be used by Overthrow if available.

- Jets - Hornets will spawn and NATO will use upgraded Radar + Towed AA, in future updates the carrier will also be used. But this DLC will remain as optional for the near future.
