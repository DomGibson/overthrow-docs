# Getting Started
Mainly, you will need to know how to start in overthrow. This guide will help you get started in overthrow. Refer to the sidebar for more information and the start guide to make sure you have the prerequisites.

You are part of a resistance known as the AAF. You are tasked with completing objectives to help the resistance and to weaken the government. The government is also tasked with completing objectives to strengthen their control over the island.

Visit the AAF flag on the map in your starting location to start off. You will be given an objective to take out NATO within a distance and a fresh Firearm.

The Government are the BLUFOR faction. They are the main enemy of the AAF. They are tasked with completing objectives to strengthen their control over the island. They are identified as NATO forces or the Grendmarie.

In local Towns and Settlements, NATO will be patrolling with Grendmarie. They will target you and will hunt you down with a wanted system if you are not careful. The Grendmarie play the part of being a Police Unit, taking them down will result in a wanted level and more units to start showing up overtime.

## Stability
Stability is a key factor in Overthrow. If you take a town, you will need to keep it stable. If you do not, the town will be taken back by NATO.

Taking objectives requires Stability to lower to 0% then overthrowing the NATO forces that will try to take it back. If you do not, the town will be taken back by NATO.

When you successfully take the town and clear it of NATO forces, you will need to maintain and protect that town. If you do not, the town will be taken back by NATO.

Raising Stability is a key factor in Overthrow. It can change the prices of goods to be exported and imported. Making money needs to be sold in a Stable town and not a town that has a low stability. Complete missions and make trades to raise stability.

## Overthrowing the Government
Taking towns is one of the key objectives in Overthrow. This will take time and effort to take on NATO forces.

### Taking a Town
Start off by visiting the AAF flag on the map. In the city you want to take, you will need to communicate to the Dealer to get a mission that could interfere with stability.

Killing Grendmarie and NATO will lower stability overtime. There will often be seige if the stability is too low and you will have NATO forces coming in to take the town back.

If the Seige Percent is Blue, NATO is capturing the Objective. If the Seige Percent is Green, NATO is being overrun by the AAF and you will need to wait for the Percent to reach 100% upon which the Objective will be taken over.

### Convoy Missions
NATO will often send convoys to the towns to supply them with goods. You can take out these convoys to lower stability and make it easier to take the town.

Result in taking over the convoy and you will be rewarded with NATO vehicles. You can use this to your advantage to take out the town. As well with gear and weapons to continue your fight.

### Graffiti
A very basic way to lower stability is to graffiti the town. This will lower stability overtime and will make it easier to take the town and will force NATO and Grendmarie to come in to take the town back.

### NATO Outposts
NATO outposts are often found in the middle of the map. They are often found in the middle of the map and will be surrounded by NATO forces.

Interacting with the outposts may result in a mission to take out the outpost. This will result in a wanted level and NATO forces will come and fight back.

Helicopters of troops will be dispatched upon 2 mins before you attack the outpost. Squad sized forces will be sent to take the outpost back.

### NATO Airbases
Airbases are often used to send Air Support to the towns. They are often found in the middle of the map and will be surrounded by NATO forces.

Around Altis there are a few and can also equip the resistance with Air Support. Interacting with the outposts may result in a mission to take out the outpost.

We can use the airbases to buy and make use from air vehicles and transport that will help us take the towns and sell goods for importing and exporting.
